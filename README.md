# MongoDB client for React PHP

This library implements an async MongoDB client for PHP. It currently depends on
the [mongo extension](http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo) for BSON processing,
but all network communication is performed through
[React](http://reactphp.org/)'s event loop.

This project is highly experimental. Please do not bother to open issues for
missing functionality.
